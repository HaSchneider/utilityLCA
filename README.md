utilityLCA
==========

UtilityLCA contains a TESPy network wrapped in a SiModIn model for simulating the impact of steam as process heating medium in chemical industry.

UtilityLCA can support more accurate LCA of processes by allowing:
- Temperature dependent steam impact calculation
- Use of different multifunctionality approaches
- Adjusting of site specific parameters
- Simple integration in LCA workflow by using [SiModIn](https://github.com/HaSchneider/SiModIn)
